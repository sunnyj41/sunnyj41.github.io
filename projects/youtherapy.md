Multi-agent approach: Agents try to extract information about a particular part of you (psychology, personality, decision-making, background). One agent then combines this information to create “your” response. Add agents to increase accuracy and nuance of personification.

Memory: Models remember all the previous entries you upload, which is the knowledge they use to create you. Add more entries to improve accuracy of personification.
